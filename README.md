# production_app

A new Flutter application.

This project is aimed as a start-up innovation which outrivals other transportation service providers such as uber, ola , jugnuu etc.
Our main goal is to provide a travel trip platform where any user can play both role of driver as well as rider at one time.
It is not necessary to the users out there to have any specific registration to act as driver.
We plan to create an application where rider notifies the nearby driver available and after verifying some check points, both rider and driver meets and completes the ride.
